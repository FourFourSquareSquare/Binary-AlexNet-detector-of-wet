# Binary-AlexNet-detector-of-wet

Modified edition of [this](https://github.com/kratzert/finetune_alexnet_with_tensorflow) implementation of AlexNet, dedicated just to determining if a road ahead is wet or not.

Download the weights from [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/) and put it in the same directory as all the other python files from this repository.

Big thank you to my advisors Xinhua and Ms. Jefferson
